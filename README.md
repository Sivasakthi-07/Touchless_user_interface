# Touchless_user_interface

# The project presents the segmentation of hand gestures by establishing Touchless User Interface (TUI).

# TUI commands the computer via gestures such as hand without touching the keyboard, mouse or screen. 

# This allows the application to draw different shapes such as circle, rectangle, lines free hand drawing and eraser. 

# In addition, a human hand is segmented from a complicated background and detected in real time is recognized by convolutional neural network.
